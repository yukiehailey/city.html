<p>Ipoh (/ˈiːpoʊ/) is the capital city of the Malaysian state of <strong>Perak</strong>. Located by the Kinta River, it is nearly 180 km (110 mi) north of Kuala Lumpur and 123 km (76 mi) southeast of George Town in neighbouring Penang. As of 2010, Ipoh had a population of 657,892, making it the fourth largest city in Malaysia by population.[2]

Originally a village, <em></em>Ipoh</em> began to grow rapidly in the 1880s after huge deposits of tin were discovered within its vicinity.[3] By 1895, it was the second largest town within the Federated Malay States, which also consisted of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang.[4] Ipoh was declared a city in 1988.[3][4] However, following the depletion of its tin deposits and the collapse of tin prices in the 1970s, the city suffered decades of decline and neglect.[5][6][7][8]</p>
